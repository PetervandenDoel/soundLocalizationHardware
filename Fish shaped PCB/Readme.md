This is a fish shaped version of the through hole PCB. This one ended up being more convenient to use than the non fish shaped version simply because there were no exposed stitches that created the risk of shorting. It is, however, hard to hold in a vise and somewhat sharp so be careful.

The fish shaped was imported into altium by putting a fish picture in Microsoft paint, filling it in black, using an online PNG to DXF converter, importing the outline onto the mechanical one layer in altium from the DXF file, and then defining board shape based on selected objects.

The thin lower fin on the original fish picture ended up coming out a bit too thin and JLC said there might be risk of breakage so that part was filled in extra in Microsoft paint and another DXF was generated to fix the problem. It is easier to modify the image in Microsoft paint than make a new DXF than it is to actually modify the mechanical one layer in altium.

The sharp ends on the fins ended up getting a little bit warped in a vice when soldering the circuit board, but it was a nice $5 meme and it works well enough to be our daily driver for hydrophone testing.
